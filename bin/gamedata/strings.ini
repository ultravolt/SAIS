STARTGAME_MUCRON1 Lextor Mucron, notorious robot smuggler, Tiberian moonshine baron and wise guy has offered you an intriguing and dangerous proposition; a scheme so potentially lucrative it could set you up for life.
STARTGAME_MUCRON2 The Exploration Pact of 4578 clearly states that the exploration of Sector Prime by an unlicensed starship is illegal. No government-sponsored attempts are to be made until the new thorium fission drive has been perfected by the Galacticorp labs on Solace. Meanwhile, each of the five continents is poised with its own space program awaiting this new star drive technology.
STARTGAME_MUCRON3 Lextor Mucron plans to ignore the pact and send you on a deep space mission of exploration and exploitation despite your erratic record as a space pilot. Because you are currently unemployed he knows that you are eager to return to space at any price.
STARTGAME_MUCRON4 Mucron's long shot mission is risky and unlawful but you find the idea of adventuring for profit irresistable. Convinced, you agree and sign his contract.
STARTGAME_MUCRON5 Mucron provides you with a modified military corvette and crew. It has been refitted as an explorer with a larger cargo bay but retains its standard military weaponry, armor and drives.
STARTGAME_MUCRON6 He explains that this is to be a ten year round trip voyage.  Upon your return the costs of the mission will be weighed against any discoveries you bring back. A late return will only cost you more.
STARTGAME_MUCRON7 Far above the dark side of the Tiberian moon you engage your starship's chemical thrusters and prepare to leave the Glory system. Thus begins your strange adventure in Infinite Space.

As you witness firsthand the destruction of the Glory system by exotic weapons of unimaginable power, your strange adventure in Infinite Space ends, finally and spectacularly.
ENDGAME_DEATH1 During a valiant space combat engagement the %s is overwhelmed and utterly destroyed. Your career as an adventurer in Infinite Space is at an end.
ENDGAME_DEATH2 The %s is inexorably drawn into a black hole by massive gravitational forces. Time begins to slow as your ship accelerates steadily until it and everything aboard is stretched thin like spaghetti. Your career as an adventurer in Infinite Space is at an end.

ENDGAME_DEATH5 The %s has been blown to bits by a fusion bomb planted by a ruthless saboteur. As the seething sphere of burning debris expands outward from the blast your strange adventure in Infinite Space concludes in an untimely way.
ENDGAME_DEATH6 The Glory system, including the colony homeworld of Hope, the moons Tiber and Solace, and all human inhabitants, has been harvested by the dread Yellow Kawangi. Nothing remains but countless tons of cosmic debris orbiting a dim neutron star. Mankind's strange adventure in Infinite Space has come to an untimely and unfortunate conclusion.
ENDGAME_DEATH7 The Glory system, including the colony homeworld of Hope, the moons Tiber and Solace, and all human inhabitants, has been annihilated by a vacuum collapser device. Nothing remains. A void of deep space now extends five light years in every direction. The %s has no homeworld to return to. Your strange adventure in Infinite Space has come to a horrifying and unthinkable conclusion.
